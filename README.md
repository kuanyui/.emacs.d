# ˊ・ω・ˋ Emacs~~
This is an init file for a non-programmer. Without any warranty surely because this is just for my personal usage. =w=+

## Requirements
- Linux or OSX. (Mainly used on Linux, Havn't tried on Windows. OSX may broken because I've left it for a long time.)
- Emacs 26.1 (Basically I always follow latest stable. See git's tags for other versions)
- Recommended for CLI Emacs.

## Usage

```shell
cd && git clone --recursive https://github.com/kuanyui/.emacs.d
```

## Byte Compile Packages in `elpa/` (Optional)

Compile `.el` into `.elc`.

```shell
emacs --load ./byte-compile-packages-in-elpa.el
```
